Abstract:

  Organisms can flexibly shift their phenotype to match environmental demands. In the face of both unpredictable challenges like severe weather, and predictable events like the energetically demanding periods of reproduction, appropriate phenotypic flexibility may result in higher fitness. Microbial flexibility, the ability to dynamically restructure the gut microbiome in the face of environmental change, may mediate phenotypic flexibility in fitness-related traits such as body mass. To explore whether the gut microbiome can act as a mediator of phenotypic flexibility, I analyzed the cloacal microbial diversity and flexibility of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) during incubation and nestling provisioning from three populations breeding across a geographic range in Tennessee, New York, and Alaska. The cloacal microbiome of breeding female tree swallows was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing. During incubation, populations differed significantly in microbial alpha and beta diversity. Microbial alpha diversity (Faithâ€™s Phylogenetic Diversity) during incubation significantly predicted mass loss, but only in birds from New York. However, across all locations, I did not find support for the hypothesis that dynamic restructuring of the gut microbiota facilitates adaptive mass loss. Future studies should use a functional genomic approach to test for microbial genes that may relate to host metabolism and mass change. Exploring the relationship between gut microbial diversity and the phenotypic flexibility of traits, such as body mass, can provide insight into the mechanisms through which organisms cope with changing environments and their ability to cope with increasing climatic variability.
